The purpose of this assignment was to utilize our newly aquired skills and create a front-end web application from scratch. The group came together to ensure our web application solved a real world problem by intergrating data received from two different server-side APIs. VINformation is a web application that may be used to search a vehicle by inputting a VIN number and receiving information about it. The informaton retured includes the make, moodel, drive type, fuel type, engine cylinders, engine horsepower, top speed, vehicle type, and an image of the vehicle.
